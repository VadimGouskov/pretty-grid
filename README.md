## Introduction 
Creating and manipulating elements in grid structures involves a lot of boilerplate code involving nested for loops. 
`pretty-grid` provides a range of classes and methods to do the heavy lifting so you can focus on the esthetics and logic of your grid structures.

Using a couple of lines of code, you can already create a pretty complex looking grid.
```js
// Grid (cols, rows, width, height)
const grid = new Grid(20, 10, 500, 500);
grid.draw(point => whiteDot(point.x, point.y));
grid.draw(point => orangeCircle(point.x, point.y), and(oddRows(), oddCols()));
grid.translate(10,10)
    .draw(point => blueDot(point.x, point.y), evenRows());
...
```
results in:

> To make this example unopinionated, we illustrate this example using the `whiteDot`,  `orangeCircle` and  `blueDot` pseudo methods to draw a grid on an html canvas. You as the developer, implement your own functions to draw to your target of choice.

## Getting started

### Browser

For a browser based project, add the folowing script tag to your `index.html` file

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pretty-grid"></script>
```

All `pretty-grid` features can now be accessed from the `prettyGrid` global object.

```js
const grid = new prettyGrid.Grid(3, 5, 500, 500);
grid.draw(point => ...));
```

A browser example project can be found [here](https://github.com/VadimGouskov/pretty-grid/tree/main/examples/browser-simple-p5)

### Node

For a nodejs based project, install `pretty-grid` using:

```bash
npm install pretty-grid
```

import features from `pretty-grid`

```js
import { Grid } from 'pretty-grid';

const grid = new Grid(3, 5, 500, 500);
grid.draw(point => ...));
```
A node based example project can be found [here](https://github.com/VadimGouskov/pretty-grid/tree/main/examples/node-typescript-p5)
